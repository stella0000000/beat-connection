# world-music
In World, Music, users will be able to:
- enter an track they enjoy listening to. 
- a related/similar track will be found somewhere around the world, and mapped on an interactive globe
- a user will be able to click on the country, and find a link to that artist's SoundCloud (tentative) page
- lines will be drawn connecting artist to artist around the world, kind of like a flight track

# WIREFRAME
The wireframe in progress is available here:
